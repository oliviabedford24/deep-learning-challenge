# deep-learning-challenge

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, we have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.
With our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The 'Alphabet Soup Mode Files' folder contains the Starter Code file, which is the initial preprocessing and running of the model without any optimization made. The three AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization files contain the edits made to boost the accuracy of the model. The summary and analysis of these models is contained in the 'Alphabet Soup Model Analysis' pdf file on the main branch.

The code contained in this repository is my work and mine alone. I received advice and input from Rice University's team of instructors (shoutout to Samad), but the code itself is my work. 

Slay, serve, survive,
